# Hello friend! Welcome to my Github

## A bit about me:
I'm mekauf2 aka Matt Kaufmann, a <a href = 'https://capp.uchicago.edu/'>Computer Science/Public Policy<a> grad student at the University of Chicago 🎓
</p> 
Before that, I was an Associate for J.P. Morgan's Power & Renewables Investment Bank, and I am a total dork for all things power ⚡

## I am excited to learn how to use data for good!
</p>
Please feel free to connect with me via <a href = 'https://www.linkedin.com/in/kaufmannmatthew/'> LinkedIn<a> and we can collaborate :)
